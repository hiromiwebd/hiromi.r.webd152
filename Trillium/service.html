      <h2>What can we do for you?</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong><li>Planning</li></strong></dt>
        <dd>
          We spend time on hearings in order to make proposals that make
          customers feel more convincing.
        </dd>
        <br />
        <dt><strong><li>Web Design</li></strong></dt>
        <dd>
          By grasping the identity and concept of the company and services
          through hearing, we produce a total design such as logos and
          pamphlets.
        </dd>
        <br />
        <dt><strong><li>System</li></strong></dt>
        <dd>
          We propose flexible system design considering the balance between cost
          and function, and the balance between cost and performance.
        </dd>
        <br />
        <dt><strong><li>Web Marketing</li></strong></dt>
        <dd>
          At the time of design and operation, we will make the results with
          suitable human resources.
        </dd>
        <br />
        <dt><strong><li>Maintenance</li></strong></dt>
        <dd>
          If the production, advertising operation, and system are disjoined, it
          will be difficult to cooperate and respond flexibly. Because of us, we
          have al the highly specialized human resources.
